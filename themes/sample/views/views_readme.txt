# Overriding Views

You can override views by putting custom `rhtml` or `liquid`
templates in this directory. You use the same folder structure
as Rails:

  views/
    [controller_name]/
      _overriden_partial.rhtml
      overriden_action.rhtml

*Note:* These are overrides! They will only work if they have
a matching view in the main rails `app/views` folder.
